# Weather Prediction

## Overview

Weather forecasting is a science and a very important and crucial requirement in daily life. In this project we will develop a machine learning model accurate enough for predicting the weather conditions.

## Reason for selecting the topic

We chose this topic because weather forecasting is one of the most complex equations to solve. Machine learning model will give an accurate result as desired in weather forecasting.

## Description of the source of data

The source of our dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahirkukreja/delhi-weather-data. It is a weather dataset for the New Delhi city in India. 
This data was taken out from wunderground with the help of their easy to use api. It contains various features such as temperature, pressure, humidity, rain, precipitation,etc. from the year 1996 to 2017.

## Questions to answer with the data

With the given atmospheric condition such as temperature, pressure, humidity, rain, snow, etc. we are trying to predict the weather if it is haze, rain, cloudy or clear.

## Communication Protocols

Our group meets on Zoom every 2-3 days to discuss whether our work in the project is ready to be uploaded to the main GitHub branch. In between those meetings, we use our "Group 8" Slack groupchat to share files and ideas for the project's direction. Each individual team member has their own GitHub branch.
