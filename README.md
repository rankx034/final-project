# Weather Prediction

## Overview

Weather forecasting is a science and a very important and crucial requirement in daily life. In this project we will develop a machine learning model accurate enough for predicting the weather conditions.

## Reason for selecting the topic

We chose this topic because weather forecasting is one of the most complex equations to solve. Machine learning model will give an accurate result as desired in weather forecasting.

## Description of the source of data

The source of our dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahirkukreja/delhi-weather-data. It is a weather dataset for the New Delhi city in India. 
This data was taken out from wunderground with the help of their easy to use api. It contains various features such as temperature, pressure, humidity, rain, precipitation,etc. from the year 1996 to 2017.

## Questions to answer with the data

With the given atmospheric condition such as temperature, pressure, humidity, rain, snow, etc. we are trying to predict the weather if it is haze, rain, cloudy or clear.

## Machine Learning

Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

Takes in data from the provisional database
Outputs label for input data

## Database Integration

Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
