Dashboard overview:
-We'll likely use Tableau and the visualizations we created with the SKlearnmetrics. 
-Heatmaps, bar graphs
-Tableau interactive will probably include user clicking on weather condition/feature or certain year/day
to be able to see necessary information about a certain data point.
- We'll feature a link to our Tableau page on the last slide of our presentation.
- We'll have the confusion matrix/ prediction overview on the Google slides
